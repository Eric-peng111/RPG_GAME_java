## Activity 0 Feedback

### Task 0.1

Generally good, however if the user won and upgraded, it will freeze, and no command is hinted or accepted.
There are also other issues like this.

### Task 0.2

## Activity 1 Feedback

### Task 1.1

The user story describes a basic RPG game.

### Task 1.2

The issues are not allocated. Usually it should be broken down to smaller tasks and allocated to different people. Just an epic board for a task is not enough. Issues should have a definition of done.

## Activity 2 Feedback

Branch names are confusing. One of the biggest issues is both main and master exist at the same time. Branch names does not describe the function well, and no notes for pull requests. No milestone.

## Activity 3 Feedback

### Task 3.1

Empty index page, and the game description is at the bottom which the logic flow is confusing.

### Task 3.2

Top level doc is too brief.

### Task 3.3

Good coverage.
